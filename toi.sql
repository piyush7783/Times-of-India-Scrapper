Nearly 95 lakh voters in six major cities with municipal corporations -Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot, Bhavnagar and Jamnagar -will vote on Sunday, in the first civic elections to be held in Gujarat after former chief minister Narendra Modi left the state to take over as Prime Minister. The elections are a challenge for chief minister Anandiben Patel as the BJP, in the 2010 elections, had won 79% of the seats -443 out of 558 -in these six municipal corporations.  	Back in 2010, despite the aggressive campaign by Modi, the voting percentage was just 44% in these cities. How many voters will turn up at the EVM machines this time is a matter of concern for both the BJP and the Congress.  	In all, a total of 1,856 candidates are in the fray in the six cities and voting will take place at 12,616 polling booths. This civic election is also special as it is the first after 50% reservation for women in civic elections was introduced. How many of the 44.79 lakh women voters are enthusiastic enough to come out and vote is a matter of conjecture.  	The Patidar movement for reservation and the riots that accompanied it, along with factors like anti incumbency, civic issues like poor water supply, pock-marked roads, choked drains, the health infrastructure that was inadequate o the challenge of swine flu and dengue out breaks, high taxes and poor public transport are very much on the minds of the voters.  	In cities like Ahmedabad, Rajkot and Su rat, even the choice of candidates by either party has become a reason for indifference among voters.  	\"These civic elections are an important test of leadership for chief minister Anandiben as these are the first polls after Modi. Also, nearly 41 assembly constituencies, a majority of which belong to the BJP, happen to fall in these six cities. The civic elections will actually set the tone for the 2017 assembly polls,\" said a senior BJP leader.  	One of the major worries for both the BJP and the Congress parties is how to prod the voters to come out and exercise their franchise.The BJP, for instance, has set up spe cial squads in Surat, Ahmedabad and Rajkot to mobilise voters after 2pm on Sunday.

And PM Modi is not alone, a similar test awaits Congress president Rahul Gandhi, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and BSP supremo Mayawati. \n\n\nMritak Sangh, an association of living people declared dead in revenue records either fraudulently or by mistake, has decided to field candidates against Modi and other top political leaders like Rahul, Akhilesh and Mayawati.\n\n“We will field our members against these leaders to highlight the plight of the ‘living dead’ people,” Mritak Sangh president Lal Bihari ‘Mritak’ told reporters at the Rajghat cremation ground in Azamgarh on Friday.\n\n“Election mein hum keval ‘murdey’ khade karte hain (We field only dead people in elections). This is the best way for a ‘living dead’ to show that he is alive,” he said. \n\n“It is unfortunate that the living dead, whose names were struck from all records after they were declared dead in their village register, have to run from pillar to post to get their names re-registered in records,” he said.\n\n“Although after an Allahabad high court order in 2000, thousands of such people were declared alive in government records, they are yet to get possession of their properties. All major political parties, including BJP, have ignored these unfortunate people who have been struggling for decades to get justice,” he said.\n\n“Mritak Sangh has so far facilitated ‘rebirth’ (re-registration of their name in revenue records) of more than a thousand people,” claimed Lal Bihari, a native of Amilo village of Azamgarh district. \n\nIn July 1977, Lal Bihari (64) had been declared dead by his relatives who got his name removed from revenue records to usurp his property. \n\nHe filed nomination for Lok Sabha byelection in 1988 and contested from Allahabad against VP Singh, Kanshi Ram and Sunil Shastri to prove that he is alive. He also contested from Amethi in 1989 against Rajiv Gandhi and Rajmohan Gandhi and since then he has contested six more elections — from assembly to local bodies — till he was finally declared alive on June 30, 1994. \n\nAfter being declared alive in 1994, he filed a Rs 25 crore compensation suit against UP government for being declared dead for 17 years. His work got him the Ig Nobel from Harvard in 2003. But as he could not travel to Harvard at that time, he was formally honoured in February 2014 at BITS Pilani at the conclave of Ig Nobel winners. Ig Nobel is a parody of the Nobel Prize awarded to celebrate ten unusual achievements.\n\nBihari now claims that he has devoted himself to the cause of living dead and has fielded many candidates in past elections. \n\n“Though the nomination papers of the living dead are rejected every time, we continue to take part in the electoral process just to raise the issue of such people,” he said. \n\n'),
